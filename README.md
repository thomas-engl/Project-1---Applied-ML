# Project-1---Applied-ML

Members: Lars Bosch, Philipp Br√ºckelt and Thomas Engl

This project is about evaluating the Regression Methods OLS, Ridge and LASSO for the Runge function including various Gradient Descent techniques.

The used packages can be found in the requirements.txt fileand can get installed through 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

# Structure:
Code/ex39_1.ipynb: code to plot bias variance trade off for OLS

Code/Project1a_b.py: code to plot the MSE of Rdige for different lambda and polynomial degree

Code/gradient-plots.ipynb: code for gradient descent implementation, plots and tabels

Code/cross-validation.ipynb: code for cross-validation and bootstrap plots for comparison
