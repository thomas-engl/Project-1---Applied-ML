# Project-1---Applied-ML

Members: Lars Bosch, Philipp Br√ºckelt and Thomas Engl

This project is about evaluating the Regression Methods OLS, Ridge and LASSO for the Runge function including various Gradient Descent techniques.

The used packages can be found in the requirements.txt file and can get installed through 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

# Structure:

Code/bias\_variance\_tradeoff.ipynb: code to plot bias-variance trade-off for OLS

Code/ols\_ridge\_analytic.py: python functions to compute OLS and Ridge Solutions and create plots of the results

Code/ols\_ridge\_analytic\_run.ipynb: code to run the methods from Project1\_a\_b.py

Code/gradient-plots.ipynb: code for gradient descent implementation, plots and tables

Code/cross-validation.ipynb: code for cross-validation and bootstrap plots for comparison
